## Introduction

The keywords ```async``` and ```await``` can help make asynchronous code easier to understand (or, make it more readable like synchronous code). 

```async``` -lets JavaScript know you are declaring a asynchronous function. ```await``` will be required to use inside of this function. A function declared with ```async``` automatically returns a promise. Throwwing an error will reject the promise. 

The ```await``` keyword tells JavaScript to wait for an asynchronous action to finish before continuing the function. Instead of calling ```.then()``` after a asynchronous function, you would assign a variable to the result ```await```.
