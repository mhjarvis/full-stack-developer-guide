## Introduction

While HTML and CSS provide some ways to validating forms, the Contstraint Validation API provides a way to validate form on the frontend with Javascript. One of the major issues with relying on just HTML/CSS for validation is that there is no way to style the output. Another issue is the problem of browser compatibility.

The goal is to get the right data, in the right format, while protecting the users' data and while protecting ourselves from faulty or malicious data.

In order to take control of the look and feel of native error mesages, you need to use JavaScript.
