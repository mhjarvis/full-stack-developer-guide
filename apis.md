## Introduction

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide for a way to serve data to users for external uses. APIs are accessed through URLs. How these are accessed depends on the service. This is usually documentd on the service's website. 

In most cases, you will also need to create an account and request access to a services data (get an API key). That key will usually need to be included with each data request. This leads to limitations that your key will generally have, especially if free.
